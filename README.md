# Event-Extraction
## Introduction
Event extraction is a vital task in natural language processing (NLP) aimed at identifying and extracting structured information about events from unstructured text. 
Beginning with text preprocessing to clean and prepare data, the process involves detecting event spans using techniques like pattern matching or machine learning models, followed by entity extraction to identify relevant entities such as people, organizations, and locations. 
These events are then categorized into classes based on semantics, often utilizing supervised learning methods, and relations between entities are extracted to provide additional context. 
Post-processing steps refine the extracted information, resolving ambiguities and ensuring consistency. 
This process finds applications across various domains, including news analysis, social media monitoring, and biomedical text mining, playing a pivotal role in tasks such as summarization, information retrieval, and knowledge graph construction, with ongoing advancements leveraging machine learning and deep learning techniques to improve accuracy and efficiency.
